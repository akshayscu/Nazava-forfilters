# Nazava-forfilters

“Frugal innovation Lab”, the lab has relations with Social enterprise that
work in the Developing economies, I was involved in a project where I created an app for the Enterprise
that works in Indonesia, making Water filters called “Nazava Filters”. The problem they were facing was,
they had they their salesmen in these areas they sold filters at very affordable rate, the problem was
that Indonesia is made up of lot small islands, and the company’s Data center was located in the Capital
city, so the receipts from these sales were meant to be sent by the salesmen to the Data center, but it
took 5-6 days for the receipts to reach the data center, this was creating a lot of chaos at their Data
center. So, they wanted an app such that the salesmen could take a picture of the receipt and send as an
email attachment and then that information gets incorporated into their system! I created the app and
helped them resolve the issue, was a multiple activity App.
